# Writing an Interpreter in Elixir

This is my attempt to follow along with the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) but writing the code in Elixir instead of Go. I'm more familiar / "compatible" with Elixir than with go, and with Elixir's pattern matching a few things are simplified here (or so I think!).

I'd consider myself a "mid-level" Elixir developer and have probably made mistakes in this code. If you see something that you know of a better way to do then I will accept a PR to teach me the right ways :)

Commits are tagged with the section of the book that the code is from.
